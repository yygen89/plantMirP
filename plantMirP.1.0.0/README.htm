<h3>About This Program</h3>

<p>
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a predominant type of small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) approximately 21 nucleotides in length that play an essential role at the post-transcriptional level by either RNA degradation, translational repression or both through an RNA-induced silencing complex. 
Identification of these molecules can aid the dissecting regulatory functions. The secondary structures of plant pre-miRNAs are much more complex than that of animal pre-miRNAs. 
In contrast to prediction tools for animal pre-miRNAs, more less efforts have been contributed to plant pre-miRNAs. 
A set of novel knowledge-based energy features, which has very high discriminatory power, is proposed and incorporated with existing features for speci&#64257;cally distinguishing the hairpins of real/pseudo plant pre-miRNAs. 
A promising performance of area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.94444 indicates that 5 knowledge-based energy features have very high discriminatory power. 
The 10-fold cross-validation (CV) result demonstrates that plantMirP with full features has a promising sensitivity of 93.55% and a specificity of 71.61%. 
Furthermore, plantMirP can greatly balance sensitivity and specificity for real/pseudo plant pre-miRNAs. 
Taken together, we developed a promising SVM-based program, plantMirP, for predicting plant pre-miRNAs by incorporating knowledge-based energy features.

<h3>Training model </h3>

<p>Before prediction pre-miRNAs, a SVMs model should be constructed with the following command:</p>
<p>perl plantMirP_training.pl  -P genuine_premirna.fa -N negData.fa </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
